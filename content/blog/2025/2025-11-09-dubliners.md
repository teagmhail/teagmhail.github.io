I’d heard a lot about *Ulysses* and wanted to read it but was advised to read Dubliners first:
> *“It’s written in similar style but shorter and you can try it and see if you like it. And if you do then move on to the bigger Ulysses. Some characters from Dubliners appear there too and it’s the same city of course, so it’ll feel like returning to already familiar places.”*

So I followed the advice.

It’s written in the beginning of 20th century and it’s a collection of short stories about different people who aren’t connected to each other (except that they all live in Dublin obviously).

I’ve never been a big lover of mainstream literature (or “literary fiction” if you prefer this term) and have always been more inclined toward sci-fi or fantasy (but not pulp, of course). Common literature often felt too narrow or formulaic, unless the author is not a literature genius like Kafka or Hemingway, for example. Still, if you’re such master of language and vision, why not make your work even richer, as Márquez did? But that’s not the main point here, let’s get back to the book. And looking ahead, I’ll say it right away that the book is great.

Each story is a glimpse into somebody’s life: sometimes a kid, sometimes an adult. Or a group of people – where, I’d say, the main character is the event they’re sharing and not them themselves. And I don’t know how Joyce does that, but he makes you feel the mood of the story without deliberate description or explanation. In some stories it’s precisely the lack of explanation, like absence of something that creates something and makes the story great. It’s like a shadow you can’t name, and those are my favorites. Here are a few I liked the most (minor spoilers ahead).

*An Encounter* – two schoolboys skip classes and go for an adventure to another part of the city. One of them dreams of meeting a man with green eyes – a symbol of real adventure for him. He never explains why he has this particular feature in mind, maybe he picked it from an adventure book he read. And then, they actually meet a green-eyed man. This story definitely has something of Salinger in it. I know that *The Catcher in the Rye* was written almost 50 years later, but it shares a similar spirit.

*Araby* – a boy wants to visit the “Araby Bazaar” fair to buy a gift for a girl he likes. He can’t go there without adults’ permission and must ask them and wait. When he finally gets there, this is nothing like what his imagination had pictured. But it's not just disappointment. All his ideas collapse. When the fair closes and the lights go out, that sense of worthlessness, helplessness, and insignificance felt like the universe itself being switched off, like in the end of Arthur C. Clarke’s *The Nine Billion Names of God*. (There’s no connection at all between the stories, it’s just the image that came to my mind when I read those lines.)

*Eveline* – a young woman is preparing to leave home that no longer feels like one, with a sailor with whom she has romantic feelings. He wants to take her with him to Buenos Ayres, but she still can't make up her mind, though she doesn't know why. I didn’t understand the meaning of the story until I read some notes about it, like what actually “going to Buenos Ayres” implied at that time.

*Clay* – a middle-aged unmarried woman celebrates Hallows Eve with the family of her friend, whom she once nursed as a child. The story is written as if it were meant to be warm but the misfortunes that happen to her and Joyce’s hints, like a traditional fortune-telling saucers game they played or her slips in the song make it heartbreaking and even shivering.

These stories stayed with me the most, probably because of the technique I mentioned, when what’s left unsaid and subtle hints say more than direct descriptions. But all of them are good. Some others I also found great, like *A Painful Case* (about a smart but lonely man), and some remind me of O. Henry, though they're not humorous – *Two Gallants*, for example.

Perhaps I’ve been wrong to be so judgmental about mainstream literature as a whole. It indeed needs less imagination, and the stories are based on biographical events from the life of Joyce and his family, but it takes great talent to describe them this way. Joyce has a way of wrapping small, ordinary moments in something that lingers. *Dubliners* is a perfect example of how one can masterfully write about the ordinary affairs of ordinary people.

I definitely recommend the book to everyone.

*Ulysses*, see you soon.
