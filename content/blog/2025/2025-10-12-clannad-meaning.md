I adore Clannad (the Irish music band) and it's not obvious what their name actually means. There's no such word in Gaeilge, but when you try googling it, some sources say it means *family*. It doesn't. *Family* in Irish is simply *clann* and *Clannad* comes from *Clann as Dobhar*.

> *We formed the band in 1970 and called ourselves Clann as Dobhar, which is Gaelic for Family from Dore. A few years later, we just picked the “a” and the “d” and became Clannad.*

It's mentioned on Wikipedia, but when I first went looking for the meaning, I couldn’t find a clear answer, so that tiny discovery felt worth keeping.
