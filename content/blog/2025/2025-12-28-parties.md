Imagine a party – a familiar one, the kind you've probably been to dozens of times. It starts with games or quizzes, or something silly like that, something structured and shared. It’s genuinely fun. You’re present, you're having a great time, and you enjoy watching people try things they hadn’t done before, laughing at themselves, being open. You feel part of something. It feels good to be there.

And then it ends.

Something shifts. You look around and see people talking, music playing – mostly music you don’t like. You join the conversations, but you don't understand their point. There's no presence in them. No listening. No attention. They feel empty, mechanical.

You tell yourself, "Wait, this can't be right. It was great just a moment ago."

You look around again and see the same people who were laughing and enjoying the same things as you. And they still seem to be enjoying themselves. And you don't understand why you aren't, you start wondering what's wrong with you.

You don't get it. You don't like it. Something is different now. People who seemed warm and interesting moments ago begin to look like empty shells. You think about leaving. But instead, you cling to the feeling you had earlier, you want to bring it back, but you don't know how.

And of course, there's alcohol.
You drink in an attempt to smooth the sharp edges, to dull what doesn't fit and keeps poking at you.

At first, it seems to be working. There's a brief euphoria, and you tell yourself you're fine, that you're enjoying it again. You’re smiling, nodding along to shallow noise, dancing to music you don’t even like. But the longer you stay, the louder your inner voice becomes, and alcohol can't silence it.

It keeps screaming: the emptiness is still here. It's telling you that the conversations still feel shallow, as if they're trying to fill the void, but only emphasize it. That the music feels unbearable. You wonder whether it’s the alcohol making you nauseous or the realization itself.

You keep convincing yourself that you can tune in. You just need to find the right balance. So you keep drinking. But it doesn't help.

What you don't realize at first is that the emptiness isn't inside you. It's around you, and you can't fill it. The longer you try, the deeper you sink into a slow, bottomless spiral.

If you’re lucky, someone leaves and you leave with them. Or maybe your voice of reason breaks through and you escape on your own.

But if you're deaf to yourself – or if there’s some other stupid reason to stay, like a quiet hope about someone you like but don’t know how to talk to – the descent continues. You might fall asleep. You might vomit. You might say things you didn’t mean or never wanted to say.

Don't do that.

There’s nothing wrong with you. Or with anyone else. It’s okay to feel differently. It’s okay to not enjoy what others enjoy. You don’t have to pretend.

Don’t betray yourself.
