I was just googling movies about Ireland, and *Hunger* was on the list. I didn't read anything about it before watching, so I thought it was going to be about the Great Famine, but it turned out to be a different story.

The film is about Bobby Sands, a member of the IRA who was imprisoned by the British authorities, and about what happened to him and the others who were jailed alongside him.

Almost the entire film takes place inside the prison. Only brief moments – seen through the perspective of a British officer or through Bobby’s memories – show the outside world. What the film depicts is what a human being can do when everything is taken from him: freedom, rights, home, country – everything. When nothing is left, there is still one thing: your life. And even that can be used for something meaningful, even if in a horrible and devastating way.

*Hunger* quite openly draws a parallel between Bobby Sands and Christ, because he intentionally puts his life on the altar of what he believes is right. But this doesn't make the story any less meaningful or powerful. It's simple, but simple in the way great deeds often are.

The film is extremely brutal and realistic, and in an hour and a half it shows how ugly and miserable the fate of people who chose what they believed to be right can be, and how, even naked, starving, and locked in cells with walls smeared with their own excrement, they appear Promethean and almost sublime in comparison to their jailers.

At the same time, it shows that even within injustice there are traces of humanity. While Margaret Thatcher, in her hypocrisy, tries to belittle and distort what these people did for their home and their nation, there are still individuals on the other side who cannot fully turn away. Like a riot policeman who breaks down in tears when others beat the prisoners. Or a medical orderly who cannot save Bobby but still tries to ease his suffering in any way he can. And that inability to truly help is itself part of the horror.

Obvious? Simple? Yes. But an idea does not become weaker when it is shown directly. And *Hunger* shows it in the most direct and uncompromising way possible.
